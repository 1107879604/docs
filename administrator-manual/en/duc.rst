Disk analyzer
=============

This tool is used to visualize disk usage in a simply and nice graph in which you can interact with click and double click to navigate in the directories tree.

After installation go in *Dashboard* and then *Disk usage* tab and click **Update** to index the root directory and to show the graph.

Usually heavier folders are stored in:

``/var/lib/nethserver/fax``

``/var/lib/nethserver/ibay`` (shared folder)

``/var/lib/nethserver/home`` (users home)

``/var/lib/nethserver/profile`` (roaming profile windows)

``/var/lib/nethserver/vmail`` (mail)

``/var/lib/mysql``
