=============
Disk analyzer
=============

This tool is used to visualize :index:`disk usage` in a simply and nice graph in which you can interact with click and double click to navigate in the directories tree.

After installation go in :guilabel:`Dashboard` and then :guilabel:`Disk usage` tab and click :guilabel:`Update` 
to index the root directory and to display the graph. This process can take several minutes depending on occupied disk space.

Well known folders are:

* Shared folders: :file:`/var/lib/nethserver/ibay`
* User home directories: :file:`/var/lib/nethserver/home`
* Windows roaming profiles: :file:`/var/lib/nethserver/profile`
* Mail: :file:`/var/lib/nethserver/vmail`
* Faxes: :file:`/var/lib/nethserver/fax`
* MySQL databases: :file:`/var/lib/mysql`
