====================
Internationalization
====================

These are the coding conventions for NethServer i18n. Each package
repository should respect them.

* The developer prepares the translation source strings when he writes
  the code.

* Each translation catalog must be mapped to a resource on Transifex_.

* Whenever new strings are added or existing ones are changed, source
  catalogs must be pushed into Transifex with `Transifex client`_: ::

    tx push -s

gettext
^^^^^^^

The ``xgettext`` command can be used to extract strings from the
source code. The resulting ``.pot`` file must be named
:file:`locale/<rpmname>.pot`.


Server Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All source language catalog files are placed in
:file:`root/usr/share/nethesis/NethServer/Language/en`. We assume
``en`` is ``en-US``.

The catalog format is a common PHP file where the array variable
:samp:`$L` is assigned some keys: ::

  <?php

  $L['string_id_1'] = 'This is an example';
  $L['string_id_2'] = 'What is a PHP array catalog?';

1. Omit ending sequence :samp:`?>`.

2. Use UTF-8 encoding.
      
Given a module with name "Test", the source language file will be
:file:`root/usr/share/nethesis/NethServer/Language/en/NethServer_Module_Test.php`.

When the Server Manager is running in debug mode, missing translation
labels can be found in :file:`/var/log/messages`.  To enable the
debug,

* Unlock ``index_dev.php`` controller: ::
    
    touch /usr/share/nethesis/nethserver-manager/debug
    
* Prepend ``index_dev.php`` on URLs path, eg:
  :file:`https://<ipaddress>/index_dev.php/en/<module>`.
